    'content': "These are frames from a video taken by a camera mounted in the front of a car. The images are taken at a 0.5 second interval. \n    The scene is described as follows: Based on the front-view camera images, here's a description of the driving scene: The car is positioned in the middle of a multi-lane road, with a visible traffic light showing a green signal. The traffic light is green, indicating that the car is allowed to proceed forward. The road is divided by lane markings, with a straight lane in the center and a left-turn lane to the left of the car. There are other vehicles visible in the image, including a white car to the left of the car, a black car to the right, and a construction vehicle in the background. There are also pedestrians visible on the sidewalk to the right of the car, crossing the road. The surrounding environment includes trees and buildings, indicating an urban setting. The car is driving smoothly, following the lane markings and the traffic light. There are no immediate obstacles or hazards in the immediate vicinity, and the overall scene appears to be calm and orderly.. \n    The identified critical objects are  In the driving scene, you should pay attention to the two-wheeled vehicle in the center of the image, which is a bicycle. It is located in the middle of the road, and it is likely moving towards the camera. This road user is important because it poses a potential hazard to the autonomous driving system, as bicycles are not designed to handle the same level of traffic as cars and motorcycles. It is crucial to be aware of such road users to ensure safety for all road users.. \n    The car's intent is Based on the lane markings and the movement of other cars and pedestrians, the ego car appears to be in a position to make a left turn. The lane markings indicate a left-turn lane, and the car is positioned in a way that suggests it is preparing to make a left turn. The current speed of the ego car should be adjusted to match the speed of the traffic around it, ensuring safe and smooth navigation through the turn.. \n    The 5 second historical velocities and curvatures of the ego car are [4.5,0.2], [4.5,0.2], [4.8,0.2], [4.2,0.2], [4.1,0.0], [3.5,0.3], [3.8,0.1], [4.0,0.3], [3.5,0.1], [3.4,0.4]. \n  Output only your predictions for the future speeds and curvatures of the vehicle in the style of [speed_1, curvature_1], [speed_2, curvature_2],..., [speed_10, curvature_10] for the next 10 timesteps in the style of a python tuple."}]
